### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Iâ€™m a Student, YouTuber, Flutter Developer, and Pythoneer!

Hi, I'm Tushar Khatri, a passionate self-taught Flutter Developer and a freelance software engineer from India. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Flutter
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin and Swift â˜º
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with others
- ðŸ¥… 2022 Goals: Study and contribute to Open source projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am the laziest person and that's why I choose to code.
