### Hi there 👋
## I’m a Student, YouTuber, Flutter Developer, and Pythoneer!

Hi, I'm Tushar Khatri, a passionate self-taught Flutter Developer and a freelance software engineer from India. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Flutter
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin and Swift ☺
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with others
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Study and contribute to Open source projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am the laziest person and that's why I choose to code.
